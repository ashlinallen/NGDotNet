**Requirements:** Visual Studio 2015, Entity Framework, SQL Server Express, NodeJS, IIS (w/ URLRewrite module), Git, Powershell

If you have already installed any of the utilities listed below, feel free to skip the install step for that utility (take note of what steps you deviate from to help troubuleshooting if you encounter problems.)

**[32]** I recommend enabling File Name Extensions in File Explorer so you can see what filetypes you're working with. (Otherwise files that start with a dot will show up as blank files. IE: .gitignore just shows up as an icon.)

***

Install applications:
> **Open an elevated command prompt:**
> - Click 'Start'
> - Type 'cmd'
> - Right-click cmd.exe (Command Prompt)
> - **[1]** Click 'Run as Administrator' (Click 'Yes' on User Account Control dialog)

Launch Powershell to install Chocolatey (Chocolatey is a desktop app manager, it will make installations easier for Git and Node since they have path settings to configure):
> **At the cmd prompt:**
> - **[2]** @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command "(iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))) >$null 2>&1" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
> - **[3]**

Close the command prompt and re-open it (as you did in step 1,) so you have access to the choco path variable

Use Chocolatey to install Git (NPM depends upon Git):
> **At an elevated command prompt:**
> - **[4]** choco install git.install -y
> - **[5]**

Use Chocolatey to install Node.js:
> **At an elevated command prompt:**
> - **[6]** choco install nodejs.install -y
> - **[7]**

Close the command prompt and re-open it (as you did in step 1,) so you have access to the NPM path variable

Use NPM to install Bower globally:
> **At an elevated command prompt:**
> - **[8]** npm install bower -g
> - **[9]**

Use NPM to install Gulp globally:
> **At an elevated command prompt:**
> - npm install gulp -g
**[TODO: GET SCREENSHOTS FOR THIS STEP]**

Install SQL Server 2014 Express:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42299

Install URL Rewrite:
http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite#additionalDownloads


***


Add the NGDotNet application to IIS:
> - Click 'Start button'
> - **[23]** In the search box, enter 'IIS' and click the item (Internet Information Services)

Add new website in IIS for NGDotNet project:
> - **[24]** Right-click 'Default Website' and click 'Remove', then click yes on the confirmation.
> - **[25]** Right-click 'Sites' node in the left panel and click 'Add Website'
> - Enter 'NGDotNet' into the 'Site name' field
> - Set the 'Physical Path' to the NGDotNet.Web directory (EX: C:\dev\NGDotNet\NGDotNet.Web)
> - Ensure 'Application Pool' is set to 'NGDotNet'. If it isn't, click 'Select', and choose the 'NGDotNet' App Pool.
> - **[26]** Click 'OK'

NOTE: If you change the port from 80, you also need to change the Browserify 'browserPort' setting in \NGDotNet.Web\gulp\config.js

Add application to hosts file:
> - **[27]** Start Notepad with administrator priveleges:
> - Click 'Start'
> - Type 'notepad'
> - Right-click notepad.exe
> - Click 'Run as Administrator' (Click 'Yes' on User Account Control dialog.)

> - **[29]** Add the following record to your hosts file:
> - 127.0.0.1 NGDotNet.local
> - Save and close the hosts file.


***


Open and configure the solution in Visual Studio:
Double-click the NGDotNet solution file (Ex: C:\Dev\NGDotNet\NGDotNet.sln)

Configure solution:
Prevent Visual Studio from launching a browser for us when you debug:
> - **[37]** Right-click the NGDotNet.Web project in the Solution Explorer > Click Properties
> - **[38]** Under the Web tab, click 'Don't open a page. Wait for a request from an external application.'
> - Close the NGDotNet.Web properties tab and save if prompted

Change startup project for solution:
> - **[39]** Right-click the main NGDotNet Solution and click Properties
> - **[40]** Under the 'Startup Project' tab, select 'Single Startup Project' and change the dropdown the NGDotNet.Web
> - Click 'Apply', then click 'Ok'

Prioritize global Node version over the version Visual Studio 2015 installed:
> - **[42]** Click Tools > Options in Visual Studio 2015
> - **[41]** Under Projects and Solutions > External Web Tools:
> - Reorder locations so that $(PATH) is above $(DevEnvDir)\Extensions\Microsoft\Web Tools\External
> - **[44, 45, 46]** Close and re-open the 'dev' gulp task in Task Runner Explorer
> - **[43]** You may need to Allow Node to communicate on your network.

> - **[47]** Once the dev tasks completes, the BrowserSync task will automatically open your proxied IIS server in your browser. Just to be clear, IIS is hosting the site at http://ngdotnet.local/ and the Node module BrowserSync is proxying the IIS site to inject CSS and HTML changes on-the-fly.

Build the solution:
> - **[48]** In Visual Studio, click Build > Build Solution


***


Create initial database migration, then run your migrations to update (create, in this case,) the database:
> - **[49]** In Visual Studio 2015, click View > Other Windows > Package Manager Console
> - In the Visual Studio Package Manager Console, ensure that the 'Default project' setting is set to 'NGDotNet.DAL' and run the following commands:
> - **[52]** add-migration InitialCreate -force
> - **[53]**
Note that after running InitialCreate has created a migration at NGDotNet.DAL/Migrations/ which, when run, will create your database to match your Models at NGDotNet.API/Controllers/

Now, run the following command in the package manager console to create your database:
> - **[54]** update-database
> - **[55]**

Add AppPool user permissions so your app has SQL access:
> - Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio:
> - Click 'Start'
> - Type 'Management Studio', select the SQL Server 2014 Management Studio item
> - Click 'Connect' with the default connection string
> - Expand 'Security' node
> - Right-click 'Logins' node
> - **[56]** Click 'New Login...'
> - **[57]** Enter 'IIS APPPOOL\NGDotNet' into the 'Login name' field
> - Click 'User Mapping' node
> - Check 'Map' on the 'NGDotNet' database
> - Check all roles except 'db_denydatareader' and 'db_denydatawriter'
> - **[58]** Click 'OK'


***


**[59]** Now you can access the NGDotNet application at http://localhost:3000/ (BrowserSync proxy,) and http://ngdotnet.local/ (directly access IIS.) If all went well, you should be able to access the Avengers tab on the left, which will perform a GET request in our Angular app. This step fully demonstrates a back-end agnostic front-end, utilizing AngularJS and SCSS, built in NodeJS using Gulp and Browserify, which accesses a C# .NET WebAPI back-end and a SQL datasource with Entity Framework 6.

If you have trouble getting the solution running, feel free to leave a comment below and I'll try to get you up and running.

Thanks for reading!
